                <li>1 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
                <li>1 lrg onion, finely diced</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>2 tsp ground coriander</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp ground turmeric</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp garam masala, divided</li>
                <li>1 (14oz) can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
                <li>2 (14oz) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
                <li>1 cup cilantro leaves, roughly chopped</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="steps">
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine garlic, ginger, chiles, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a mortar and pestle or in the small work bowl of a food processor and pound or process until a fine paste is produced. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat oil or ghee in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. All at once, add mustard seeds and cumin. They will sputter and spit for a few seconds. As soon as they are aromatic (about 15 seconds), add onion all at once, along with baking soda. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions start to leave a brown coating on bottom of pan, 3 to 4 minites. Add 1 tablespoon water, scrape up browned bits from pan, and continue cooking. Repeat this process until onions are a deep brown, about 10 minutes total.</li>
                <li>Immediately add garlic/ginger/chile paste all at once and stir to combine. Add coriander, black pepper, turmeric, and 1 teaspoon garam masala. Stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and crush them using a whisk or potato masher. Add drained, rinsed chickpeas and cilantro, reserving a little cilantro for garnish. Add 1/2 cup water.</li>
                <li>Bring to a simmer, cover with lid slightly cracked and reduce heat to maintain a gentle bubbling. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has reduced into a thick stew and spices have melded, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in remaining garam masala and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt. Serve with rice and/or naan, sprinkling additional cilantro on top.</li>
            </ol>
